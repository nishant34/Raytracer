# Raytracer
Basic raytracer in C++
* This contains the code to implement a basic raytracer in C++ to render a colored sphere depending on the light source position. Coordinates can be adjusted in the code and finally the code can be run using :
```
g++ Raytracer.cpp
```
* Then a .ppm file will be generated which can then be converted to .jpg file online.
